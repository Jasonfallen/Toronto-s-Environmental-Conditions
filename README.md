A Study Focus on Toronto's Environmental Conditions

Toronto, Ontario's increased industrial pollution is having a severe influence on the city's environmental conditions. Despite the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change's attempts to enhance the environment, efforts must be refocused on a regular basis to be effective. Tree cover, pollutants discharged into the air, pollutant carcinogenic Toxic Equivalency Potentials (TEP) score, and pollutant non-carcinogenic TEP score were determined as four primary elements that might impact the ecosystem after study and debate.
